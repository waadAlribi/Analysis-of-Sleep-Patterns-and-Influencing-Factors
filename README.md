Sleep Disorder Prediction

This project focuses on predicting sleep disorders using machine learning models. The dataset includes various features related to physical activity, stress levels, and sleep patterns to predict disorders such as Sleep Apnea, Insomnia, and No Disorder.

Dataset:
The dataset contains the following columns:
Gender: The gender of the person (Male/Female).
Age: The age of the person.
Occupation: The occupation of the person.
Sleep Duration: The total hours of sleep per day.
Quality of Sleep: Rating of sleep quality (from 1 to 10).
Physical Activity Level: The amount of physical activity in terms of percentage.
Stress Level: The level of stress on a scale of 1-10.
BMI Category: Body Mass Index category (Normal, Overweight, Obese).
Heart Rate: The heart rate of the person.
Daily Steps: The number of steps taken per day.
Sleep Disorder: Target variable, categorizing the sleep disorder (Sleep Apnea, Insomnia, No Disorder).

Models Used:
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost

Objective:
The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict sleep disorders based on the provided features. We evaluated the models based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Accuracy:
The best performing model achieved an accuracy of 89%.
